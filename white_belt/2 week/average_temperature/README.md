### Programming Task: Average Temperature 

Temperatures are given for _N_ consecutive days. Find the numbers of days (numbered from zero) with a temperature value above the arithmetic mean for all _N_ days.

It is guaranteed that the arithmetic mean of the temperature values ​​is an integer.

### Input format 
The number _N_ is entered, then _N_ non-negative integers — the temperature values ​​on the 0th, 1st, ... _(N−1)_th day.

### Output format 
The first number _K_ is the number of days in which the temperature value is above the arithmetic mean. Then _K_ integers are the numbers of these days.

### Example 
**Input**
```objectivec
5
7 6 3 0 9
```
**Output**
```objectivec
3
0 1 4
```
