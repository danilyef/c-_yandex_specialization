### Programming Task: Inference with Precision 

The *input.txt* file contains real numbers, one per line. On standard output, print these numbers in the same order, one per line, but make sure that each of them has exactly three decimal places (rounding is done according to standard rules, i.e. 0.1234 rounds up to 0.123, and 0.1235 up to 0.124).

**Input 1**
```objectivec
5
0.34567
10.4
```
**Output 1**
```objectivec
5.000
0.346
10.400
```
**Input 2**
```objectivec
3.33353
3.333
3.3
```
**Output 2**
```objectivec
3.334
3.333
3.300
```
