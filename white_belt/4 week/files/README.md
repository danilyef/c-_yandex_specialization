#### Programming Task: Working with Files ####

In this assignment, you will write two small programs. Each item is a separate task, send the solution to the field with the corresponding number.

##### Part 1 #####
Your program should read the contents of the *input.txt* file and print it to the screen unchanged. It is guaranteed that the content of the *input.txt* file ends with a newline.

###### Example ######
**input.txt**
```objectivec
Kepp calm
and
learn C++
```

**stdout**
```objectivec
Kepp calm
and
learn C++
```

##### Part 2 #####
Read the entire contents of *input.txt* again, but this time output it to *output.txt*. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the contents of the *input.txt* file end with a newline.


###### Пример ######
**input.txt**
```objectivec

```

**output.txt**
