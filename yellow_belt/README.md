# C++ Development Fundamentals: Yellow Belt

![image](img.jpg)

This course is a continuation of the course *"Basics of C++ Development: White Belt."* In it, the instructors further introduce you to the capabilities of the C++ language. The course covers:  

- C++ integer types  
- Pairs and tuples  
- Function templates  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Iterators and standard algorithms  
- Splitting code across multiple files  

Additionally, the course explores the use of unit tests for debugging programs and ensuring code reliability. It also demonstrates how to develop your own unit test framework using only the knowledge gained from the "White" and "Yellow" Belts.  

As with the *White Belt* course, you will complete a final project at the end. In the *White Belt,* you developed a simple data storage system with basic functionalities like adding, deleting, and searching. In the *Yellow Belt,* you will enhance this storage system by adding support for more complex queries.
