### Programming Task: Case Insensitive Sorting 

### Condition 
The standard stream is given one line, consisting of the number *N* followed by *N* lines *S*. The numbers and lines are separated by a space.

Sort strings *S* in ascending lexicographic order, ignoring case, and write them to standard output.

### Restrictions 

- 0 <= N <= 1000
- 1 <= |S| <= 15
- Each string S[i] can consist of the following characters: [0-9,a-z,A-Z]

### Examples 
|             stdin              |             stdout             |
|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| 2 q A                          | A q                            |
| 3 a C b                        | a b C                          |
