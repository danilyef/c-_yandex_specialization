In the course **"C++ Development Fundamentals: Red Belt"**, the following topics are covered:  
- **Macros**  
- **Class Templates**  
- **Code Optimization Principles**  
- **Efficient Use of Input/Output Streams**  
- **Algorithm Complexity Analysis**  
- **C++ Memory Model**  
- **Effective Use of Linear Containers** (*vector*, *deque*, *list*, *string*)  
- **Move Semantics**  
- **Introduction to Multithreaded Programming**  

Additionally, the course demonstrates how, using knowledge from only the **"White"**, **"Yellow"**, and **"Red"** belts, you can develop your own profiler.  

As in previous courses, there is a final project waiting for you at the end: you will be tasked with creating your own search engine!
