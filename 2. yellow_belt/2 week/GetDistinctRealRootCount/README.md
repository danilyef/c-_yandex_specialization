### Programming Task: Tests for the GetDistinctRealRootCount Function 


Function
```objectivec
int GetDistinctRealRootCount(double a, double b, double c);
```
returns the number of unique real roots of the equation *axÂ² + bx + c = 0*. Develop a set of unit tests to verify that this feature is implemented correctly. **The case when all three coefficients are equal to zero does not need to be tested**.
